```

**Key Points:**
- **`src/core/`** = The workflow engine (@scrum-workflow/core, reusable, independent)
- **`src/cli/`** = The scaffolding CLI tool (creates projects with src/core installed as `scrum_workflow/`)
- **`src/docs/`** = All documentation and guides (organized, out of root)
- **Monorepo**: Single `npm install`, shared root dependencies, separate packages

**Backward Compatibility:**
- User projects install with `frameworkPath: "scrum_workflow"` (unchanged, still works)
- Only **repository** structure changed; user **installations** completely unaffected
- Existing projects continue to work without any migration

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation (3 minutes)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd scrum-workflow

# Install root + workspace dependencies (src/core and src/cli)
npm install

# Link CLI globally (for development)
npm -w src/cli link

# Install into your project
cd /path/to/your-project
create-scrum-workflow install
```

**What gets installed:**
- 20 workflow commands (skill shims)
- Framework files (read-only)
- Configuration files (your customizations)
- Output directories for artifacts

### 2. Initialize Your Project (2 minutes)

```bash
# Generate project context from your codebase
/scrum-create-project-context

# This analyzes your code and creates domain-specific context
# for smarter AI assistance throughout the workflow
```

### 3. Create Your First Story (1 minute)

```bash
/scrum-create-ticket SW-001 "Add user authentication with OAuth2"
```

**That's it!** Your story is created. Now refine it, develop it, review it, and approve it using the commands below.

**In a nutshell:** Spec → Validate → Code → Review → Ship (with human gate at the end)

## ✨ Why Use Scrum Workflow?

### Problem It Solves
- **AI reliability:** AI makes mistakes → structured phases with human gates prevent bad code shipping
- **Slow feedback loops:** Developers implement from vague specs → spec-first approach catches ambiguities before coding
- **Isolated blindspots:** Developer writes code AND reviews own work → separate reviewer agents catch missed issues
- **No audit trail:** Who decided what when? → all decisions recorded with reasoning

### What You Get

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Unclear requirements** | Multi-agent refinement (architect, developer, QA perspectives) |
| **Slow implementation** | AI-powered development following clear, validated specs |
| **Poor code quality** | Separate code review agent + immutable spec validation |
| **No traceability** | Complete audit trail of all decisions and changes |
| **Bottlenecks** | Parallel agent analysis, validated gates, human approval only at end |
| **Tool-lock** | Framework works across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Cline |

### Real-World Impact
- **50% faster specs** — Multi-agent refinement finds gaps in hours, not days
- **Zero bad merges** — Code review agent + human sign-off prevent regressions
- **Clear accountability** — Every change recorded with who, what, when, why
- **Framework-agnostic** — Works with any AI coding assistant platform

---

## 📋 The Workflow

Every story follows a strict lifecycle. No phase can be skipped. Each transition is guarded.

```
draft → refinement → refined → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → approved → done
                                                                ↓
                                                          changes-needed
                                                                ↓
                                                           in-progress (fix & re-review)
```

**Want the full walkthrough?** See [GETTING-STARTED.md](./GETTING-STARTED.md) for step-by-step with examples.

### Phase-by-Phase Explanation

#### Phase 1: Create Story (`draft`)

```bash
/scrum-create-ticket SW-001 "Add user authentication with OAuth2"
```

Takes a natural language description and produces a structured story file with YAML frontmatter, acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format, and initial estimation. This is the entry point -- no development begins until a spec exists.

**Output:** `_scrum-output/sprints/SW-001/story.md` with `status: draft`

---

#### Phase 2a: Multi-Agent Refinement (`draft` → `refinement` → `refined`)

```bash
/scrum-refine-ticket SW-001
```

Spawns three specialized AI agents in parallel, each analyzing the story from their expert perspective with isolated context:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Architect** | Architectural risks, scalability, security, dependencies |
| **Developer** | Technical feasibility, implementation complexity, libraries |
| **QA** | Testability, acceptance criteria clarity, edge cases |

The agents then engage in **cross-talk rounds** (up to 3) where they comment on each other's findings, classify disagreements as blockers/non-blockers, and work toward consensus. Security issues are automatically marked as blockers.

After cross-talk, **Wideband Delphi estimation** collects independent story point estimates from all three agents, with variance checking and re-estimation rounds if estimates diverge.

You review each perspective individually (accept/reject), and accepted findings are merged into the story via deduplication and conflict resolution.

**Why `refined` exists as a separate status:** The multi-agent refinement is expensive (3 agents, cross-talk, estimation). The `refined` status marks "refinement complete" so that if validation fails in the next phase, you only re-run the lightweight validation -- not the full 3-agent process.

**Output:** Updated `story.md` with `status: refined`, `refinement.md` with full audit trail

---

#### Phase 2b: Validation Gate (`refined` → `ready-for-dev`)

```bash
/scrum-refine-story SW-001
```

A validation-only agent checks the story against an **immutable 5-criterion checklist**:

| # | Criterion | What it checks |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Acceptance Criteria | All criteria are testable and unambiguous |
| 2 | Tasks Defined | All subtasks are specific and actionable |
| 3 | Dev Notes | Sufficient technical context for implementation |
| 4 | No Placeholders | No TODO, TBD, FIXME, or `{{placeholder}}` markers |
| 5 | Dependencies | All dependencies identified and documented |

The agent **cannot modify** the story -- it can only validate. This is the [Feature List as Immutable Contract](https://www.agentic-patterns.com/patterns/feature-list-as-immutable-contract) pattern.

- **PASS:** Status becomes `ready-for-dev`, execution plan (`plan.md`) is assembled
- **FAIL:** Status stays `refined`, failure reasons documented. Fix issues and re-run

**Output:** `plan.md` with ordered subtasks and dependencies (on PASS)

---

#### Phase 3: Development (`ready-for-dev` → `in-progress`)

```bash
/scrum-dev-story SW-001
```

Implements the story following the specification and execution plan. The dev agent uses [Inversion of Control](https://www.agentic-patterns.com/patterns/inversion-of-control) -- it receives a plan and **just executes it**:

- No self-validation (separate command does that)
- No self-review (separate agent does that)
- No planning (plan already exists)
- Direct output to code files (no summary reports)

When implementation is complete, trigger the review:

```bash
/scrum-dev-story SW-001 review
```

This transitions the story to `review` status after verifying all tasks are complete and tests pass.

**Output:** Implemented code, `story.md` updated to `in-progress` then `review`

---

#### Phase 4: Code Review (`review` → `approved` or `changes-needed`)

```bash
/scrum-review-story SW-001
```

A **separate AI agent** (ideally a different model) reviews the code using the [AI-Assisted Code Review](https://www.agentic-patterns.com/patterns/ai-assisted-code-review-verification) pattern. The reviewer evaluates against:

| # | Criterion | What it checks |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Specification Alignment | Code matches story spec (no extra, no missing features) |
| 2 | Acceptance Criteria | All AC satisfied by implementation |
| 3 | Test Coverage | Adequate tests for the changes |
| 4 | Code Standards | Follows project conventions |
| 5 | Architecture Compliance | Follows patterns from Dev Notes |

Each finding gets a severity (Critical/Major/Minor) and a suggested fix.

- **APPROVED:** No critical issues. Status becomes `approved`
- **CHANGES-NEEDED:** Critical/major issues found. Status becomes `changes-needed`

**Why `changes-needed` is a separate status:** It provides explicit visibility into stories that went back for rework after review. Without it, you can't distinguish "first implementation" from "fixing review findings" -- important for tracking and metrics.

If changes are needed, the developer fixes the issues and re-submits:

```bash
/scrum-dev-story SW-001        # Fix findings (status: changes-needed → in-progress)
/scrum-dev-story SW-001 review # Re-submit for review (status: in-progress → review)
/scrum-review-story SW-001     # Re-review
```

**Output:** `review-N.md` with findings table, verdict, and suggested fixes

---

#### Phase 5: Human Approval (`approved` → `done`)

This is the final gate. No AI agent can mark a story as done -- only an explicit human decision.

The approval workflow presents the review findings and asks for a clear APPROVE or REJECT decision. An audit trail (`approval.md`) records the decision, approver, and rationale.

**Output:** `approval.md`, story status becomes `done`

---

### Setup for Development

```bash
# Install root + all workspaces
npm install

# Run tests for a workspace
npm -w src/core test          # Test core engine
npm -w src/cli test           # Test CLI installer
npm test --workspaces         # All tests

# Link CLI globally (for testing locally)
npm -w src/cli link
create-scrum-workflow install /tmp/test-project

# Build/sync templates (if modifying)
npm -w src/cli run sync-templates
```

### Key Development Points

1. **Core** (`src/core/` → `@scrum-workflow/core`)
   - Workflow engine — commands, agents, skills
   - Published to npm for external use (from `src/core/`)
   - Fully independent (no external framework lock-in)
   - Templates in `src/core/templates/`
   - Tests in `src/core/__tests__/`

2. **CLI** (`src/cli/` → `create-scrum-workflow`)
   - Scaffolding tool — installs core into user projects
   - Dependency: `@scrum-workflow/core` (workspace: file:../core)
   - Templates mirrored from `src/core/templates/` for installer bundle
   - Path resolution: uses relative paths (`../../../templates/scrum_workflow` from test location)
   - Binary entry: `src/cli/bin/create-scrum-workflow.js`

3. **User Projects** (after installation)
   - Generated structure: `scrum_workflow/` (framework path — unchanged)
   - Config: `scrum_workflow/config.yaml` (installed by CLI)
   - Skills/templates: all in `scrum_workflow/` subdirectory
   - Completely backward compatible — no migration needed

4. **Changes Impact**
   - Modify **src/core/** → Rebuild templates → CLI installs new version
   - Modify **src/cli/** → Test installer with `npm -w src/cli test` before merging
   - Modify both → Run full test suite (`npm test --workspaces`)

5. **Documentation** (`src/docs/`)
   - All guides, references, and architectural docs
   - Linked from README and main docs index
   - Organized by topic (development, architecture, etc.)

### Branch & PR Workflow

1. Branch from `main` for any feature/fix
2. Update story and test files during development
3. Run `npm test --workspaces` before opening PR
4. PR must pass all AC (acceptance criteria) from story.md
5. Approved via `/scrum-review-story` and human sign-off

## Design Principles

1. **Spec-First**: No code without a specification. No implementation without a plan.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Different agents for refinement, implementation, and review. No agent reviews its own work.
3. **Explicit over Implicit**: Every status transition is guarded. Every decision is auditable. Every phase produces documented output.
4. **Human Gate**: AI assists, humans decide. No story ships without explicit human sign-off.
5. **Write Boundaries**: Phase isolation. The dev agent cannot modify the plan. The review agent cannot modify code.
6. **Atomic Operations**: All file writes are atomic (temp file + rename) to prevent corruption.
