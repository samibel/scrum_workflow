> **Note:** The authoritative definition of all states and transitions lives in [`scrum_workflow/context/standards.md`](../context/standards.md) — Story Status State Machine section. This document provides diagrams and supplementary detail. In case of any conflict, `standards.md` is the single source of truth.

## Status Values

| Status | Description | Next States |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `draft` | Story created, not yet refined | → refinement |
| `refinement` | Multi-agent refinement in progress (implementation-internal sub-state, not in FR-4's 9 states) | → refined (on completion) |
| `refined` | Refinement complete, awaiting validation | → ready-for-dev |
| `ready-for-dev` | Validated and ready for implementation | → in-progress |
| `in-progress` | Development in progress | → review |
| `review` | Implementation complete, awaiting review | → approved / changes-needed |
| `approved` | Review passed, awaiting human approval | → done |
| `changes-needed` | Review found issues requiring fixes | → in-progress (after fixes) |
| `done` | Story complete with human approval | Terminal state |
| `cancelled` | Story cancelled by explicit user decision | Terminal state (from any non-terminal state) |

## State Transition Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft
    draft --> refinement: /scrum-refine-ticket
    refinement --> refined: Refinement complete
    refined --> readyForDev: /scrum-refine-story PASS
    refined --> refined: /scrum-refine-story FAIL
    readyForDev --> inProgress: /scrum-dev-story
    inProgress --> review: Implementation complete
    review --> approved: /scrum-review-story APPROVED
    review --> changesNeeded: /scrum-review-story CHANGES-NEEDED
    changesNeeded --> inProgress: /scrum-dev-story (fix findings)
    approved --> done: /scrum-approve (human sign-off)
    done --> [*]
    draft --> cancelled: Manual decision
    refinement --> cancelled: Manual decision
    refined --> cancelled: Manual decision
    readyForDev --> cancelled: Manual decision
    inProgress --> cancelled: Manual decision
    review --> cancelled: Manual decision
    approved --> cancelled: Manual decision
    changesNeeded --> cancelled: Manual decision
    cancelled --> [*]
```

> **Note on `any → cancelled`:** The diagram lists each non-terminal source state explicitly (draft, refinement, refined, ready-for-dev, in-progress, review, approved, changes-needed). `done` is intentionally omitted — it is a terminal state and cannot be cancelled. The authoritative rule is: **any non-terminal state → cancelled** (see `standards.md` Valid Transitions table).

## Guard Conditions

See [`scrum_workflow/context/standards.md`](../context/standards.md) — Valid Transitions table for the complete, authoritative guard conditions for every transition. That table is the single source of truth; no duplicate summary is maintained here.

---

## Readiness Criteria (for → `ready-for-dev` transition)

The `/scrum-refine-story` command validates against these criteria:

1. ✅ **Acceptance Criteria** — All acceptance criteria are testable and unambiguous
2. ✅ **Tasks Defined** — All tasks/subtasks are clearly defined
3. ✅ **Dev Notes** — Dev Notes section contains necessary context
4. ✅ **No Placeholders** — No placeholders or TODO markers in story content
5. ✅ **Dependencies** — Dependencies are identified and documented

**If any criteria FAIL**: Status remains `refined` with documented reasons

## Three-Agent Workflow (Epic 11)

The state machine supports the three-agent pattern split from Epic 11:

```
draft → refinement → refined → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → approved/changes-needed
              ↑              ↑               ↑            ↑
        /refine-ticket  /refine-story   /dev-story  /review-story
```

### Agent Pattern Mapping

| Command | Pattern | Status Transition |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `/scrum-refine-ticket` | Sub-Agent Spawning | `draft` → `refinement` → `refined` |
| `/scrum-refine-story` | Feature List as Immutable Contract | `refined` → `ready-for-dev` |
| `/scrum-dev-story` | Inversion of Control | `ready-for-dev` → `in-progress` → `review` |
| `/scrum-review-story` | AI-Assisted Code Review | `review` → `approved` or `changes-needed` |

---

## Status Validation

Each workflow phase validates status before proceeding:

```python
def validate_status(current: str, required: str, command: str) -> None:
    """Validate status before command execution."""
    if current != required:
        raise StatusError(
            f"{command} requires status '{required}', "
            f"but story is in '{current}'"
        )
```

---

## Status Update Pattern

All status updates follow atomic write pattern:

```python
def update_status(story_path: str, new_status: str) -> None:
    """Update story status atomically."""
    # 1. Read current file
    content = read_file(story_path)

    # 2. Parse and update frontmatter
    frontmatter = parse_yaml_frontmatter(content)
    frontmatter['status'] = new_status
    frontmatter['updated'] = iso_timestamp()

    # 3. Write atomically
    new_content = reconstruct_file(frontmatter, content)
    write_atomic(story_path, new_content)

    # 4. Verify update
    verify_status(story_path, new_status)
```

---

## Common Status Patterns

### New Story Flow (Three-Agent Workflow)
```
draft → refinement → refined → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → approved → done
```

### Validation Failed Flow
```
draft → refinement → refined → (validation FAIL) → refined → (fix issues) → ready-for-dev → ...
```

### Review Changes-Needed Flow
```
... → review → changes-needed → (fix issues) → review → approved → done
```

### Rejected Human Approval Flow
```
... → approved → (human REJECT) → changes-needed → review → approved → done
```

---

## Status Queries

Check story status from command line:
```bash
# Extract status from story.md
grep "^status:" _scrum-output/sprints/SW-XXX/story.md

# Or use YAML parser
yq '.status' _scrum-output/sprints/SW-XXX/story.md
```
